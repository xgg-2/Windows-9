Windows 9 Simulator
Welcome to the Windows 9 Simulator, a technical web-based project designed to replicate the aesthetic and functional experience of a desktop operating system within a modern web browser.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a Preliminary (Early) Version. It serves as a foundation for testing, architectural patterns, and UI/UX experimentation.
> 
Key Features
 * Retro-Modern Interface: A combination of classic OS design principles and contemporary web technologies.
 * Desktop Environment: Includes a functional taskbar, start menu, and interactive desktop icons.
 * Extensible Architecture: Developed as an open sandbox, allowing for easy customization and module integration.
 * Responsive Core: Optimized for simulating system-level interactions across various screen dimensions.
Installation and Setup
Follow these technical requirements to initialize the project in your local development environment.
1. Clone the Repository
git clone [https://github.com/xgg-2/windows-9.git](https://github.com/xgg-2/windows-9.git)
cd windows-9

2. Install Dependencies
Ensure that Node.js is installed on your system. Execute the following command:
npm install

3. Execution
To launch the development server, run:
npm run dev

The application will be accessible via the local address provided in the terminal (default: http://localhost:5173).
Development Roadmap
This project is intended for technical experimentation. Developers are encouraged to focus on:
 * Refining UI component logic and state management.
 * Integrating new applications and desktop utilities.
 * Implementing simulated file system protocols.
 * Enhancing window management systems and keyboard event handling.
Current Project Status
This project is currently in the early stages of development.
 * Functional Limitations: Certain UI elements are implemented as placeholders and may lack full interactivity.
 * Experimental Codebase: The architecture is subject to change as more robust features are integrated.
 * Collaboration: Technical feedback and pull requests are encouraged to improve system stability.
