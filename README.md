Key Features
User Interface
 * Retro-Modern Interface: A calculated blend of classic OS design principles and contemporary web technologies.
 * Desktop Environment: Includes a functional taskbar, system start menu, and interactive desktop iconography.
Technical Architecture
 * Extensible Framework: Developed as an open sandbox, allowing for seamless customization and module integration.
 * Responsive Core: Optimized for simulating system-level interactions across varying display dimensions and devices.
Installation and Setup
Follow these technical requirements to initialize the project in your local development environment.
1. Clone the Repository
git clone [https://github.com/xgg-2/windows-9.git](https://github.com/xgg-2/windows-9.git)
cd windows-9

2. Dependency Management
Ensure that Node.js is installed on your system. Execute the following command to install necessary packages:
npm install

3. Execution
To launch the local development server, run:
npm run dev

The application will be accessible via the local address provided in the terminal (default: http://localhost:5173).
Development Roadmap
This project is intended for rigorous technical experimentation. Current development focus includes:
 * State Management: Refining UI component logic and global state handling.
 * System Utilities: Integrating new applications and desktop tools.
 * File Systems: Implementing simulated file system protocols and data persistence.
 * Interaction Logic: Enhancing window management systems and keyboard event handling.
Project Status
 * Functional Limitations: Certain UI elements are currently implemented as placeholders and may lack full interactivity.
 * Codebase Stability: The architecture is subject to significant changes as more robust features are integrated.
 * Contribution: Technical feedback and pull requests are encouraged to improve system stability and performance.
